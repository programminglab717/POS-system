## Where we are

**Phase 0 (Foundations), step 4 of 8:** `keel-domain`. Slice 1 of 3 (payload codecs, the schema
registry, and the order's lines) is built and verified, and waiting for review. Slice 2, pricing
v0, starts after that review.

## Phase 0 milestones

From the [roadmap](./roadmap.md#8-first-engineering-milestones-the-next-build-steps).

| # | Milestone | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Monorepo scaffold | Rust workspace and CI done. The Android, web and schema directories arrive with their first code. | [`Cargo.toml`](../Cargo.toml), [CI](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) |
| 2 | `keel-types`: value types | Done, 2026-09-27 | [`core/crates/keel-types`](../core/crates/keel-types/) |
| 3 | `keel-events`: the signed, hash-chained event log | Done, 2026-09-27. Its schema registry was built with the first domain events, in `keel-domain`. | [`core/crates/keel-events`](../core/crates/keel-events/), [ADR-0012](./adr/0012-event-wire-format.md) |
| 4 | `keel-domain` (order, check, payment) and `keel-pricing` v0 | In progress: slice 1 of 3 built, waiting for review | [`core/crates/keel-domain`](../core/crates/keel-domain/), [ADR-0013](./adr/0013-event-payloads-and-schema-evolution.md) |
| 5 | `keel-store`: SQLite events, projections and outbox | Not started | |
| 6 | `keel-sim` and `keel-sync` v0 | Not started | |
| 7 | Android register shell | Not started | |
| 8 | Cloud cell v0 | Not started | |

Step 4 is split into three slices, each ending with a review:

1. **Foundations and the order's lines** (built 2026-09-28, waiting for review): payload codecs
   and schema registry; the aggregate framework; order events, fold and commands for creating an
   order, adding, changing, removing, firing, voiding and comping lines, changing attributes, and
   voiding or abandoning the order.
2. **Pricing v0**: modifier pricing, discounts, US sales tax, rounding and allocation, the
   calculation trace, and the golden-basket suite.
3. **Checks and payments**: splits and allocations, and the payment aggregate.

## Current slice

Slice 1 is complete; see its entry under "Completed", which lists the decisions to review.
Slice 2, pricing v0, hasn't started: it waits for that review.

## Completed

### `keel-domain` slice 1: payloads, the schema registry, and the order's lines (2026-09-28)

Commits `fbd1507`, `1b6dd56`. Waiting for review.

- **Built:**
  - Payload codecs: strict maps with integer keys; money, quantity, identifier, text, code and
    identifier-set encodings.
  - The schema registry, with a pinned example payload for every schema. The fold entry point
    skips events of unknown schemas, malformed payloads and other streams, and reports them.
  - The canonical order of provisional events: by clock, then device, then log position.
  - The order aggregate: ten version-1 event schemas; the order's state, with a total fold that
    applies the sync design's conflict rules and reports 15 kinds of conflict; and commands
    checked against the device's view, each producing one event that must decode under its own
    schema before it is recorded.
- **Verified:**
  - 24 known-answer tests and 12 property tests. The property tests also passed 100,000 cases
    each.
  - The pinned payloads of all ten schemas were decoded independently with Python's `cbor2`, and
    match the documented key tables.
  - Independent models:
    - a validity model of every schema, against payloads with fields changed, removed or added;
    - a model of the fold, written as queries over the events' positions. It is checked on any
      events, on events aimed at the conflict rules (colliding lines, other currencies, units
      and locations), and on devices acting concurrently on stale views;
    - a model of the command rules, checked with deliberately faulty commands.
  - 64 planted bugs, all caught, and the property tests alone catch every one.
- **Decisions:** [ADR-0013](./adr/0013-event-payloads-and-schema-evolution.md), proposed.
  - **Payloads** are canonical CBOR maps with small integer keys, decoded strictly. Money is
    `[minor units, currency code]`, and quantity `[millionths, unit code]`. Enumerations are
    integer codes.
  - **Schema evolution:** every payload change is a new version. Writers use a version only once
    every kernel at the location knows it (negotiated by sync), so a newer version never meets
    an older kernel in normal operation.
  - **Undecodable events** from a trusted device stay in the log, so the device's chain never
    stalls, but the fold skips them and the order reports them ("needs update", or malformed).
  - **Text** in names and notes can't contain control characters, which could otherwise drive
    receipt printers and kitchen displays.
  - **Events that would break the order don't apply:** a line or modifiers in another currency,
    a quantity in another unit, an event from before the order's creation or from another
    location. They stay in the log and leave a conflict, so every price in an order can always
    be added up. Conflicts are derived by the fold, not recorded as events.
  - **Commands** refuse no-op changes. A void needs a fired line (a pending line is removed). The
    first removal or void of a line wins, and so do the first comp and the first close.
  - **Flags** for a fired line removed rather than voided, and for lines added or fired after
    the order was closed.
  - **Stage** (Draft, Open, Submitted) is derived from the lines, not stored.
  - **A line records** the item's variant, name, tax category, unit price and the catalog
    version it was priced from.
  - **Version 1 is positive:** quantities above zero and prices of zero or more. Returns will
    have their own events.
  - `Id::cast`, to use an order's identifier as its event stream's.
- **Found and fixed during the build:**
  - Planted bugs found gaps twice. At first, 3 of 51 escaped every test: payload rules that span
    fields. A unit test and sharper generators closed that gap. The property tests alone then
    still missed 18 that unit tests caught. A full model of the fold, faulty commands, and
    generators aimed at rules that span fields or sit on a boundary (one currency per payload at
    any depth, text lengths, identifier sets out of order) closed it. The 13 planted bugs added
    for the new models were all caught.
  - `provisional_order` had no test; it now has known answers and a property.

### `keel-events`: the signed, hash-chained event log (2026-09-27)

Commits `34fda99`, `f79e701`.

- **Built:** a strict canonical CBOR codec; the event envelope (format 1); ES256 and Ed25519
  signatures in COSE_Sign1 messages; event hashes; the device log writer (numbering, chaining,
  timestamping and signing in two steps, so memory never runs ahead of storage); the link check
  for received events (gaps, forks, broken links, clocks going backwards); the device registry
  with revocation by log position.
- **Verified:**
  - 38 unit tests and 26 property tests, which also passed 100,000 cases each.
  - Interoperability both ways with Python's `pycose`; a pinned reference event checked
    independently with `cbor2`, `hashlib` and `pycose`.
  - 59 planted bugs, all caught; the property tests alone catch the 43 in the envelope, event,
    log and registry code.
  - CI green.
- **Decisions:** [ADR-0012](./adr/0012-event-wire-format.md), accepted 2026-09-28: a location
  field in every event, revocation by log position rather than time, one key per device for life,
  and strict decoding everywhere.
- **Found and fixed during the build:**
  - A payload nested deeper than the decoder allows could be signed but never decoded, which
    would have stalled the device's log for good. Such payloads are now refused when created.
  - Planted-bug runs were saving their failure seeds as if they were real regressions. The seeds
    were removed, and the conventions now require disabling proptest's failure persistence for
    planted-bug runs.

### `keel-types`: the kernel's value types (2026-09-27)

Commits `2bb1c68`, `493dd3b`, `de45ce0`.

- **Built:** money in integer minor units, with exact products (up to 192 bits) rounded once;
  seven rounding modes and cash rounding; rates; quantities in millionths with 47 exactly defined
  units; ISO 4217 currencies from a verified snapshot (155 circulating, 6 withdrawn); timestamps
  and clocks; hybrid logical clocks; UUIDv7 identifiers; business dates with daylight-saving-safe
  cutoffs.
- **Verified:** 110 tests and 2 doctests, with property tests against an exact `num-bigint`
  oracle and an exhaustive sweep of every time zone transition from 1970 to 2037. CI green.
- **Found and fixed during the build:** double rounding in `Money::mul_decimal` (caught by a
  generator aimed at rounding boundaries after 2,000 uniform cases missed it); parsing of
  `i64::MIN`; an order-dependent sum; a naive business-date algorithm that failed on real time
  zone histories (Algiers 1971, Samoa 2011).

### Design (2026-09-27)

Commits `a9fad0c`, `545db4b`.

Six research tracks, the architecture and eleven ADRs, the domain model, the offline and sync
design, the feature catalog and the roadmap. See the [README](../README.md).

## Waiting on a decision

- Review of `keel-domain` slice 1, and acceptance of ADR-0013.
- Whether abandoning an order should need that nothing was ever fired. Today an order whose lines
  were all voided can be abandoned, as well as voided.
- Whether to keep the planted-bug lists in the repository (or adopt `cargo-mutants` in CI), so
  anyone can rerun the checks. They are scripts outside the repository today.
- The license, and the product name ("Keel" is a codename).
- The first payment processor (decision gate G2 in the roadmap).
- Verifying the research's unverified claims, and interviews with merchants.
- Updating the pinned Rust toolchain from 1.94 to 1.98.
- License and security-advisory checks in CI (`cargo-deny`), GitHub Actions pinned to commit
  hashes, and CI on macOS and Windows.

## Known gaps

Work deliberately left for later, so it isn't forgotten:

- **`keel-events`:**
  - Enrollment and revocation records signed by the Device CA, and their distribution to replicas.
  - A way to re-admit genuine events quarantined by a revocation.
  - Hardware signers, which the platform apps provide through the `Signer` trait.
  - Negotiating schema versions between kernels, in `keel-sync`.
- **`keel-types`:** `Locale`, with the first UI.
- **Orders:**
  - Permissions, approvals and ownership leases aren't checked yet (`keel-policy`, `keel-sync`).
  - Lines added after an order is closed should go to a post-close check, once checks exist
    (slice 3).
  - Events for a person's resolution of a conflict.
  - A tool that labels payload fields, for auditors and support.
- **Pricing:** multiplying a unit price by a fractional quantity (weighed items) must round. The
  domain model lists only three places where rounding happens, so pricing v0 has to settle where
  this one belongs.

## Keeping this document current

Update "Where we are" and the current slice's table as work lands. When a slice ships, move it to
"Completed" with what it built, how it was verified, its decisions and its commits. Add every
deferred item to "Known gaps", and remove it when it's done.
